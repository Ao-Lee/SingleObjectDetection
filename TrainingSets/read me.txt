this dataset folder is an example of how training set looks.
note that the 'landmark' folder is used to generate landmark examples for the network, since MTCNN support landmark localization
if you don't have a landmark training dataset, just use this 'landmark' folder as the default, the content in the 'landmark' folder wont affect the network at all
